# Local-only real Git E2E tests
#
# Copy to: .env.git.local (repo root) and fill in credentials.
# That file is gitignored.
#
# Usage:
# - Run the local-only test file under graph-editor (see its header for the command).
#
# The test will commit a small test image to the specified branch under
# _test-artifacts/images/ and then read it back to verify the roundtrip.
# Test files are cleaned up automatically after each test run.
