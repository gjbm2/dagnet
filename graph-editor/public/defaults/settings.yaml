  # Onset derivation: α mass threshold for window() lag histograms.
  # Interpretation: onset is the earliest day by which α of conversion mass has occurred.

  # Onset aggregation: β for weighted quantile across window() slice families in the topo pass.
  # Weighted by number of dates in each window() series (dates.length).
  # β=0.5 behaves like a robust median and avoids single-slice outliers.
