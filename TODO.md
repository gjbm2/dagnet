## Backlog

### High Priority
1. Commit all needs building & testing
2. Revisit schema
3. Named nodes
4. Bring context into graph (blocked by tab system)
5. Connect Params to param registry (will be easier after tab system)
6. Google sheets pull through params

### Medium Priority
3. Nodal levels in the editor (some nodes are 'tall')   
4. auto-re-route doesn't start automatically (needs kicking)

### Low Priority
(None currently)
