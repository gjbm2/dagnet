# DagNet TODO

## In Progress

### High Priority
1. Connect Case Params to param registry 
2. Connect Conditoin p to param reg
3. GIT_BATCH_OPERATIONS_MD
4. Google sheets pull through params
5. Context support

### Medium Priority
- **Drag & Drop from Navigator to Graph** - See [DRAG_DROP_PROPOSAL.md](./DRAG_DROP_PROPOSAL.md) for full spec
  - Drag nodes/cases/parameters from navigator and drop on canvas to create/connect
  - Estimated: 36-48 hours full implementation, 28-38 hours MVP
- Nodal levels in the editor (some nodes are 'tall') & Sankey L-R mode with dyanmic node sizes
- auto-re-route doesn't start automatically (needs kicking)

### Low Priority
- main app tabs are showing maximise button even when they're maximised, it seems
- maxmised tabs are appearing on top (zorder) of navigator button (incorrect)
- maximised tabs in main app are not reflecting padding
