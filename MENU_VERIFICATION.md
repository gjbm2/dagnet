## Implementation Status

### ✅ Fully Implemented & Working
1. GraphEditor now passes all refs to GraphCanvas
2. Menu events properly trigger GraphCanvas functions
3. Undo/Redo state properly subscribed with logging
4. Edge scaling, auto-layout, re-route all connected
5. Tab context menu functional

### Issues Fixed
1. **Graph editor view options**: All refs now passed to GraphCanvas
2. **Undo/Redo not enabled**: Fixed subscription to track state changes
3. **Event handlers**: All menu commands now trigger correct GraphCanvas functions

### Code Path Verification
- **Keyboard Shortcut** → GraphEditor event handler → Store function
- **Menu Item** → EditMenu/ViewMenu → Custom event → GraphEditor handler → Store/Ref function
- **Context Menu** → TabContextMenu → TabContext operation → Same as menu

All three paths converge on the same underlying functions! ✅
