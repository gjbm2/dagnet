# Sync System Overview

Unified view of how data flows between Git, IndexedDB, FileRegistry, GraphStore, and ReactFlow — the sync arrows, triggers, guards, suppression mechanisms, and known races.

The integrative "map" tying together the detailed docs:

- `STATE_MANAGEMENT_REFERENCE.md` — inventory of all state storage layers and scopes (overlaps on the layer model; this doc focuses on *flow between layers*, that doc on *what lives where*)
- `GRAPH_WRITE_SYNC_ARCHITECTURE.md` — edit propagation pipeline detail (UI → UpdateManager → mutation → persistence)
- `SYNC_ENGINE_GUARD_STATE_MACHINE.md` — the 9 guard refs controlling sync direction and mutual exclusion
- `GRAPH_MUTATION_UPDATE_MANAGER.md` — how UpdateManager drives entity updates and topology changes
- `INDEXEDDB_PERSISTENCE_LAYER.md` — DB identity, tables, prefix contract
- `FILE_REGISTRY_LIFECYCLE.md` — in-memory cache lifecycle, dirty detection
- `GIT_OPERATIONS_ARCHITECTURE.md` — clone/pull/push/commit via GitHub API

## The five layers

```
Git Repository (remote authority, versioned, collaborative)
    ↕  clone / pull / commit (gitService, workspaceService)
IndexedDB db.files (browser persistence, source of truth for isDirty)
    ↕  dual-write on every mutation (both prefixed + unprefixed)
FileRegistry (in-memory Map, performance cache, listener notifications)
    ↕  file↔store sync (useEffect in GraphEditor.tsx)
GraphStore (Zustand, per-file, graph + graphRevision + history)
    ↕  graph↔RF sync (useEffect in GraphCanvas.tsx)
ReactFlow State (nodes/edges arrays, selection, viewport — UI only)
```

### Source of truth per concern

| Concern | Authority | Not authoritative |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| File content across sessions | IndexedDB | FileRegistry (empty on reload) |
| Dirty state for git operations | `db.getDirtyFiles()` | `fileRegistry.getDirtyFiles()` |
| Current graph during editing | GraphStore | FileRegistry (may lag by one sync cycle) |
| Node positions during drag | ReactFlow nodes state | GraphStore (overwritten on drag end) |
| Visual presentation | ReactFlow | GraphStore (different data shape) |

## The four sync flows

### Flow 1: Store → File (GraphEditor.tsx)

**Trigger**: `useEffect([graph, graphRevision])` — fires when graph or revision changes.

**Guards**:
1. Content match: skip if JSON equals last synced content

**Action**:
1. Record content + revision in `writtenStoreContentsRef` (Map, bounded to 25 entries)
2. Set `suppressFileToStoreUntilRef = Date.now() + 500` (blanket suppression)
3. Call `fileRegistry.updateFile(fileId, graph, { syncRevision: graphRevision, syncOrigin: 'store' })`

**Downstream**: FileRegistry writes to IDB (both prefixed + unprefixed), fires `notifyListeners()`, emits `dagnet:fileDirtyChanged` if dirty state changed.

### Flow 2: File → Store (GraphEditor.tsx)

**Trigger**: `useEffect([data, fileSyncOrigin, fileSyncRevision])` — fires when FileRegistry data changes.

**Guards** (checked in order):
1. **Layout suspend**: skip if `Date.now() < suspendLayoutUntilRef`
2. **Time suppression**: skip if `Date.now() < suppressFileToStoreUntilRef` (500ms after any store→file sync)
3. **Content match**: skip if JSON equals last synced content
4. **Stale echo rejection**: check `writtenStoreContentsRef.get(dataStr)` — if found and revision < current store revision, this is a stale echo of an older write → skip

**Action** (if all guards pass): `setGraph(data)` — overwrites store with file data.

**Stale echo defence**: `writtenStoreContentsRef` map tracks all content this store has written (content → revision). On incoming file→store, if the exact JSON was previously written by the store at a now-superseded revision, it's stale. **Primary defence** against the pending-replay race (see below).

### Flow 3: Graph → ReactFlow (GraphCanvas.tsx)

**Trigger**: `useEffect([graph, setNodes, setEdges, ...])` — fires when graph changes.

**Path selection**:
- **Fast path**: no topology change, no view mode change, no image boundary change → update edge data in-place, preserve drag/resize positions
- **Slow path**: full `toFlow(graph)` rebuild → new RF nodes/edges arrays

**Guards**:
- JSON match: skip if graph JSON equals last synced
- Drag guard: fast path preserves node position during `isDraggingNodeRef`
- Resize guard: fast path preserves node style during `isResizingNodeRef`
- Layout transaction guard: slow path skips during `sankeyLayoutInProgressRef`

**Sync lock**: sets `isSyncingRef = true` before setState, clears after 100ms (slow) or 0ms (fast). Prevents RF→Graph from firing during Graph→RF.

### Flow 4: ReactFlow → Graph (GraphCanvas.tsx)

**Trigger**: `useEffect([nodes, edges])` — fires when RF state changes (drag, resize, selection connectors).

**Guards** (checked in order):
1. Sankey layout in progress → skip
2. Effects cooldown → skip
3. `isSyncingRef` → skip (prevents loop during Graph→RF)
4. `isDraggingNodeRef` → skip
5. Empty-state check (nodes=0 with graph.nodes>0) → skip (spurious)
6. JSON match → skip

**Action**: `fromFlow(nodes, edges, graph)` → `setGraph(updatedGraph)`.

## Suppression mechanisms

Two independent suppression systems prevent stale data from overwriting fresh state:

| Mechanism | Duration | Set by | Prevents |
|-----------|----------|--------|----------|
| **Time suppression** (`suppressFileToStoreUntilRef`) | 500ms | Store→File sync start | File→Store firing after store write echo returns |
| **MSMDC event suppression** (`dagnet:suppressFileToStoreSync`) | 1000ms | `graphMutationService.updateGraph()` dispatch | File→Store firing during query regeneration |

These stack: if MSMDC fires during a store→file sync, the suppression window is the later of the two.

## Custom events

| Event | Dispatched by | Listened by | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| `dagnet:suppressFileToStoreSync` | graphMutationService (before setGraph) | GraphEditor | Extend file→store suppression during MSMDC |
| `dagnet:fileDirtyChanged` | FileRegistry.updateFile | UI components | Dirty state indicators |
| `dagnet:liveShareRefreshed` | liveShareSyncService | useShareChartFromUrl | Trigger chart recompute after share refresh |
| `dagnet:logicalIdChanged` | FileRegistry | Various | Parameter/context/case/node ID rename notification |

## Initialisation lifecycle

1. File created with `isInitializing: true` — dirty detection is **off** (normalisation absorbed)
2. Editor normalises content (sorts keys, injects defaults) → `updateFile` absorbs into `originalData`
3. `completeInitialization(fileId)` scheduled 500ms after load → sets `isInitializing: false`
4. From this point, dirty detection is **on**: `data ≠ originalData` → `isDirty: true`

**Failure mode**: if `completeInitialization()` never fires, file appears clean forever (all edits absorbed).

## Known races and failure modes

### Race 1: Pending replay stale echo

**Scenario**: rapid writes A→B→C within 500ms. FileRegistry queues pending updates. If pending B is replayed after suppression window expires and its exact JSON isn't in `writtenStoreContentsRef`, it looks like an external change → **store reverts from C to B**.

**Defence**: `opts` (including `syncOrigin`) is preserved during pending replay. `writtenStoreContentsRef` tracks content→revision map. Revision-based guard catches stale echoes even when `syncOrigin` is lost.

### Race 2: Pull completing during active editing

**Scenario**: user is editing a file, non-blocking pull completes and writes new content to FileRegistry.

**Defence**: 3-way merge (not remote-wins) preserves local changes. If conflicts exist, pull does not modify the file. `isInitializing` is set on merged content to allow re-normalisation.

### Race 3: ReactFlow reset clobbering concurrent mutations

**Scenario**: selection connectors call `setNodes()` (type:reset) while user is resizing → resize changes discarded.

**Defence**: `onNodesChange` filters out type:reset during active resize/drag.

### Race 4: Graph→RF overwriting drag position

**Scenario**: graph updates (from unrelated pull) during user drag.

**Defence**: `isDraggingNodeRef` forces fast path, which preserves node position. On drag end, next Graph→RF sync may overwrite — but `fromFlow` on drag-end has already committed the final position.

### Race 5: Non-blocking pull during suppression window

**Scenario**: non-blocking pull starts during the 500ms file→store suppression window.

**Defence**: pull writes to FileRegistry, notification is suppressed. After 500ms expires, next file→store sync will fire with the merged content. If pull conflicted, the conflict modal blocks further sync until resolved.

## The posterior/state propagation lesson

Common failure pattern: data exists in **four layers simultaneously** (param file → graph edge projected value → graph edge stashed slices → React render tree). Deleting from one layer is useless unless all four are handled. Before modifying any state:

1. **Trace all locations** where the value lives — grep across param files, graph edges, stashed slices, and render props
2. **Trace what triggers React re-render** — in-place mutation does nothing; `setGraph` with a new reference is required
3. **Trace the cascade** — UpdateManager mapping configurations project param file fields onto graph edges; clearing the file doesn't clear the graph copy
4. **Test idempotently** — "delete when already deleted" must still clean up all derived state

Single most common cause of multi-attempt fixes. Read GRAPH_MUTATION_UPDATE_MANAGER.md for the mapping configurations.
