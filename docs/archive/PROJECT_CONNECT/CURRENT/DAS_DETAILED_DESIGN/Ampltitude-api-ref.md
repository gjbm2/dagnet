Dashboard REST API
You can get data that's displayed on the dashboard graphs in JSON format with the Dashboard REST API.

Authentication
This API uses basic authentication, using the API key and secret key for your project. Pass base64-encoded credentials in the request header like {api-key}:{secret-key}. api-key replaces username, and secret-key replaces the password.

Your authorization header should look something like this:

--header 'Authorization: Basic YWhhbWwsdG9uQGFwaWdlZS5jb206bClwYXNzdzByZAo'
For more information, see Find your API Credentials

EU residency server	https://analytics.eu.amplitude.com/api/2/
Considerations
You may have to URL encode special characters in the names of event types, event properties, and user properties. For example, encode Play Song as Play%20Song. Use the W3Schools encoding reference for help.
Some examples in this article use backslash syntax to escape characters when using cURL. If you aren't using cURL, then don't encode your request with backslash escape characters.
The Dashboard REST API time zone is the same as your Amplitude project's time zone.
Rate limits
For each endpoint, there is a concurrent limit and a rate limit. The concurrent limit restricts the number of requests you can run at the same time. The rate limit restricts the total number of queries you can run per hour. Exceeding these limits returns a 429 error. These limits are per project, and the 429 error also includes information on how you are exceeding the limit.

Concurrent Limit: You can run up to 5 concurrent requests across all Amplitude REST API endpoints, including cohort download.

User activity/user search limits
You can run up to 360 queries per hour for user activity and user search endpoints.
The User Activity and User Search endpoints have a different rate limit than all other request types.

Endpoint costs
Endpoints use cost per query rate limit model. In this equation, cost doesn't imply a monetary value. Instead, cost refers to rate limits and API usage limits. This method helps provide equal API availability for all queries. Amplitude calculates rate costs based on this formula:

cost = (# of days) * (# of conditions) * (cost for the query type)

Here is how Amplitude determines each variable in the formula:

Number of days: This is the number of days in the query.
Number of conditions: This is the number of segments plus the number of conditions within the segments applied to the chart you are looking at. Each group by counts as 4 segments.

Segments and conditions
Segments are comparison groups. For more information, go to Add user segments.
Conditions represent top-level filters. Cohorts, WHERE, and "who performed/did" are all conditions in Amplitude. Event filters don't count as conditions with regards to API costs.
Different chart types have different costs. For all endpoints not listed here, the cost is 1.
Here are the limits for these endpoints, measured in the cost per query:

Concurrent Limit: Up to 1000 cost within a five minute period.

Rate Limit: Up to 108,000 cost per hour.

Event Segmentation: Equal to the number of events you are looking at in the left module. If any event has a group by, add a cost of 4 per group by and event.

Funnel Analysis: The number of events you are looking at in the funnel multiplied by two. If any event has a group by, add a cost of 4 per group by and event.

Retention Analysis: The cost for this chart is 8.

User Sessions: The cost for this chart is 4.

Shared query parameters
These query parameters are shared across several Dashboard REST API endpoints.

For built-in Amplitude properties, valid values are version, country, city, region, DMA, language, platform, os, device, device_type, start_version, and paying.
For custom user properties, format the key as gp:name.
Parameter	Description
e	A full event with optional property filters or group by. Events are represented as JSON objects as described in event format.
s	Segment definitions. Include as many as needed. Segments are represented as JSON arrays, where each element is a JSON object corresponding to a filter condition as described segment definition.
g	The property to group by, for example platform. Available only when there is a single segment. Limit: two.

### Inline Behavioral Cohort Segments (UNDOCUMENTED)

**Discovered 4-Dec-25**: The segment parameter also supports inline behavioral cohort definitions for filtering users based on whether they performed specific events. This is NOT documented in official Amplitude docs but works reliably.

#### Format for "who did" (include users who performed event)
```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "event_type": "EVENT_NAME",
  "filters": [/* optional event property filters */],
  "op": ">=",
  "value": 1,
  "time_type": "rolling",
  "time_value": 366
}
```

#### Format for "who did not" (exclude users who performed event)
```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "event_type": "EVENT_NAME",
  "filters": [/* optional event property filters */],
  "op": "=",
  "value": 0,
  "time_type": "rolling",
  "time_value": 366
}
```

#### Key fields:
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| type | Must be `"event"` for behavioral filters |
| event_type | The event name to filter on |
| filters | Optional array of event property filters (same format as funnel event filters) |
| op | Comparison operator: `">="` for include, `"="` for exclude |
| value | Count threshold: `1` for include (did at least once), `0` for exclude (never did) |
| time_type | `"rolling"` for relative time window |
| time_value | Number of days to look back |

#### Example: Funnel with behavioral segment filter
```bash
curl -G -H "Authorization: Basic $AUTH" \
  --data-urlencode 'e={"event_type":"Step1"}' \
  --data-urlencode 'e={"event_type":"Step2"}' \
  --data-urlencode 'start=20251109' \
  --data-urlencode 'end=20251115' \
  --data-urlencode 's=[{"type":"event","event_type":"PriorEvent","filters":[{"subprop_type":"event","subprop_key":"context","subprop_op":"is","subprop_value":["ONBOARDING"]}],"op":">=","value":1,"time_type":"rolling","time_value":366}]' \
  "https://amplitude.com/api/2/funnels"
```

#### Multiple conditions (AND logic)
Multiple behavioral filters in the segment array combine with AND logic:
```json
s=[
  {"type":"event","event_type":"EventA","op":">=","value":1,"time_type":"rolling","time_value":366},
  {"type":"event","event_type":"EventB","op":"=","value":0,"time_type":"rolling","time_value":366}
]
```
This filters for users who DID EventA AND did NOT do EventB.

#### Combining with cohort and property filters
Behavioral filters can be combined with standard segment filters:
```json
s=[
  {"prop":"userdata_cohort","op":"is not","values":["test_cohort_id"]},
  {"type":"event","event_type":"TargetEvent","op":">=","value":1,"time_type":"rolling","time_value":366}
]
```

Query parameters
Name
Description
start	Required. First date included in data series, formatted YYYYMMDD. For example,"20221001".
end	Required. Last date included in data series, formatted YYYYMMDD. For example,"20221001".
timeHistogramConfigBinTimeUnit	Optional. Time unit for bucket sizes (see below for valid inputs).
timeHistogramConfigBinMin	Optional. Minimum value for bucketing, as a number. For example, "0".
timeHistogramConfigBinMax	Optional. Maximum value for bucketing, as a number. For example, "600".
timeHistogramConfigBinSize	Optional. Size of each bucket, as a number. For example, "60".
timeHistogramConfigBin format
timeHistogramConfigBinTimeUnit is any of ['hours', 'minutes', 'seconds'].

To take advantage of custom binning, you must specify timeHistogramConfigBinMin, timeHistogramConfigBinMax, and timeHistogramConfigBinTimeUnit. When timeHistogramConfigBinSize isn't specified, Amplitude tries to find the best bin sizing. For example, if you have timeHistogramConfigBinMin=0, timeHistogramConfigBinMax=10, and timeHistogramConfigBinTimeUnit=minutes, there is no guarantee for the final number of bins or bin bounds. If timeHistogramConfigBinSize=1 is specified, then there are 10 bins, and each bin size equals a minute.

When combined timeHistogramConfigBin parameters are invalid or missing, Amplitude defaults to default bins that account for certain behaviors such as bounce rate. These bins are (in milliseconds): [0, 3000), [3000, 10,000), [10,000, 30,000), [30,000, 60,000), [60,000, 180,000), [180,000, 600,000), [600,000, 1,800,000), [1,800,000, 3,600,000), [3,600,000, 86,400,000).

Session lengths have a max length of 1 day (86,400,000 ms).
